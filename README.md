# PostgreSQL utility scripts

Some scripts to show information about the PostgreSQL database.

There are a couple of ways to try these scripts. First, cd to the directory where you cloned/downloaded this folder. Then try out either of these options:

1. `psql -f ./'<name-of-script.sql>' <your-database>`
1. Log into PostgreSQL using `psql` and from within the interactive window run the command `\i './<name-of-script.sql>'`

The [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html) utility is very flexible and powerful utility!
